# Familjen Development Guide

## Project Overview

Norwegian family planning app for managing:
- Daily pickup assignments (who picks up which child)
- Weekly meal planning with recipe storage
- Child tasks (reminders, appointments, bring items)
- Calendar sync with Google Calendar

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js 16** with App Router (pages in `src/app/`)
- **Supabase** for PostgreSQL database + Auth + Row Level Security
- **Tailwind CSS v4** with CSS variables for theming
- **TypeScript** with strict typing
- **OpenRouter** for AI meal suggestions
- **Google Calendar API** for calendar sync

## Key Patterns

### Supabase Client

```typescript
// Server component
import { createClient } from '@/lib/supabase/server'
const supabase = await createClient()

// Client component
import { createClient } from '@/lib/supabase/client'
const supabase = useMemo(() => createClient(), [])
```

### Date Handling

Always use local timezone formatting:
```typescript
import { formatDateISO } from '@/lib/utils'
const dateStr = formatDateISO(new Date()) // "2024-12-16"
```

### RLS Security

All tables use Row Level Security. Helper functions:
- `get_user_household_id()` - Get user's household (SECURITY DEFINER)
- `is_admin()` - Check app admin status
- `is_household_admin()` - Check household admin status

### Color System

Child colors: `sky | coral | sage | honey | lavender | mint`

```typescript
const CHILD_COLOR_MAP: Record<ChildColor, { bg: string; text: string }> = {
  sky: { bg: 'rgba(126, 182, 196, 0.3)', text: 'var(--color-sky)' },
  // ...
}
```

## File Structure

### Pages (`src/app/`)

| Page | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `/` | Home - Today overview with pickups, meals, tasks |
| `/uke` | Week planner - Edit pickups, meals, events, tasks |
| `/oppskrifter` | Recipe management |
| `/handleliste` | Shopping list |
| `/innstillinger` | Settings - Profile, household, members, children |
| `/admin` | Admin panel - User management, AI settings, calendar |
| `/ny-husstand` | Create new household |

### Components (`src/components/`)

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `WeekGrid` | Desktop 7-day grid with pickups, events, tasks, meals |
| `TodayOverview` | Today's summary card |
| `DayView` | Single day detail view |
| `MealSelector` | Recipe/custom meal dropdown |
| `AISuggestionModal` | AI meal suggestion interface |
| `Header` | Navigation with user menu |

### Types (`src/lib/types.ts`)

Key interfaces:
- `Household`, `HouseholdMember`, `Child`
- `Pickup`, `PickupWithDetails`
- `Meal`, `MealWithRecipe`, `Recipe`
- `ChildTask`, `ChildTaskWithChild`
- `MemberEvent`
- `DaySummary`, `WeekPlan`

### API Routes (`src/app/api/`)

| Route | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `/api/openrouter/suggest` | AI meal suggestions |
| `/api/openrouter/models` | Available AI models |
| `/api/calendar/auth` | Start Google OAuth |
| `/api/calendar/callback` | OAuth callback |
| `/api/calendar/sync` | Sync inbound calendar events |
| `/api/calendar/send-invite` | Send pickup to work calendar |

## Database Schema

### Core Tables

```sql
households          -- Family units
household_members   -- Adults (email, work_email, allergies)
children           -- Kids (name, color, location, allergies)
pickups            -- Daily assignments (child_id, picker_id, date)
meals              -- Meal plans (date, recipe_id or custom_meal)
recipes            -- Stored recipes (name, ingredients, instructions)
```

### Task System

```sql
child_tasks (
  child_id, date, time,
  task_type: 'bring' | 'appointment' | 'reminder' | 'other',
  title, notes,
  status: 'open' | 'done'
)
```

### Calendar Integration

```sql
member_events      -- Parent events (work trips, dinners)
google_calendar_tokens  -- OAuth tokens for shared Gmail
```

### Access Control

```sql
allowed_emails (
  email,
  is_admin,           -- App-wide admin
  can_create_household,  -- Can create own household
  invited_by_household_id  -- Which household invited them
)
```

## Migrations

Located in `supabase/migrations/`. Run with:
```bash
npx supabase db push
```

Key migrations (in order):
1. Base schema (households, members, children, pickups, meals)
2. Recipes and shopping lists
3. RLS policies with SECURITY DEFINER helpers
4. Admin and household admin roles
5. Child colors and allergies
6. Member events and Google Calendar tokens
7. Child tasks
8. Pickup calendar sync

## Development Commands

```bash
npm run dev          # Development server
npm run build        # Production build
npm run lint         # TypeScript + ESLint
npx supabase db push # Push migrations
```

## Norwegian UI Text

The app uses Norwegian (Bokmål). Key terms:
- Henting = Pickup
- Middag = Dinner
- Oppgave = Task
- Husstand = Household
- Innstillinger = Settings
- Ukeplan = Week plan

## Error Handling

- Use try/catch with user-friendly Norwegian messages
- PGRST116 = "no rows returned" - OK for optional queries
- 403 from RLS = Check policy and SECURITY DEFINER functions

## Calendar Integration

### Inbound (from work calendars)
- Shared Gmail receives calendar invites
- Sync endpoint matches sender email to household members
- Creates `member_events` for matched invites

### Outbound (to work calendars)
- Pickup assignments can send invite to picker's work_email
- Creates event with picker as attendee
- Stores event ID for updates/deletes

## AI Meal Suggestions

Uses OpenRouter API with context:
- Household allergies (members + children)
- Week context (free text notes)
- Existing week meals
- Previous recipes

## Permissions Model

| Role | Access |
|------|--------|
| User | Own household data |
| Household Admin | Manage household members/children |
| App Admin | All households, user management, AI settings |
